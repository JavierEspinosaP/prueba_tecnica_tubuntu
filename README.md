  - **components/**: Reusable React components.
    - **\_\_tests\_\_/**: Contains test files for components.
      - **UserList.test.tsx**: Tests for the `UserList` component.
    - **PhantomCards.tsx**: Component handling placeholder or loading states for user cards.
    - **UserList.tsx**: Component responsible for rendering a list of users.
  - **hooks/**: Custom hooks for specific functionalities.
    - **\_\_tests\_\_/**: Contains test files for hooks.
      - **useFetchUsers.test.ts**: Tests for the `useFetchUsers` hook.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (>=16.0.0)
- npm (>=7.0.0) or yarn (>=1.22.0)

## Application Functionality

This application is a React-based project that fetches and displays user information using custom hooks and components. Below is an overview of the core functionality:

### Components

- **App.tsx**: 
  - The main entry point of the application. It uses the `useFetchUsers` custom hook to fetch user data and passes the fetched data as props to the `UserList` component. The `App.tsx` file is responsible for rendering the main layout, managing the fetched data, and handling any top-level state or context providers.

- **UserList.tsx**: 
  - This component is responsible for receiving and displaying a list of users passed to it via props from the `App` component. It maps over the provided user data and renders each user's information.

- **PhantomCards.tsx**: 
  - This component likely handles placeholder or loading states for the user cards. It is designed to improve the user experience by showing visual placeholders while the actual user data is being fetched.

### Custom Hooks

- **useFetchUsers.ts**: 
  - A custom hook designed to fetch user data from an API. It manages the state of the fetch request, including loading, success, and error states. The hook returns the user data along with loading and error states, which are then utilized by the `App.tsx` component to be passed down to `UserList.tsx`.


## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ``git clone https://github.com/JavierEspinosaP/prueba_tecnica_tubuntu.git``

   ``cd prueba_tecnica_tubuntu``

2. **Install dependencies**:

   ``pnpm install``

   or

   ``yarn install``

3. **Run the development server**:

   ``pnpm run dev``

   or

   ``yarn dev``

   This will start the application in development mode. You can access it at 
   
   ``http://localhost:5173``

4. **Build for production**:

   ``pnpm run build``

   or

   ``yarn build``

   This will create an optimized build of the application in the dist/ directory.

5. **Preview the production build**:

   ``pnpm run preview``

   or

   ``yarn preview``

   This will serve the production build locally to verify everything works as expected.

## Testing

- **Run tests**:

  ``pnpm test``

  or

  ``yarn test``

  This will run all unit and component tests using Vitest.

- **Run tests with UI**:

  ``pnpm run test:ui``

  or

  ``yarn test:ui``

  This will open a UI to run and debug tests interactively.

## Configuration

- **TypeScript**: The project is configured with strict settings to enforce best practices.
- **ESLint**: Linting is set up to ensure code quality and consistency.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility classes are used for styling, making it easy to build responsive designs.
